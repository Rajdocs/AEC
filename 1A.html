<b><i>All that glitters is not gold</i></b>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
popularised in the 1960s with the release f Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <b><i>All that glitters is
not gold</i></b>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
</p>
<p>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content <b><i>All that
glitters is not gold</i></b> of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters <b><i>All that glitters is not
gold</i></b>
